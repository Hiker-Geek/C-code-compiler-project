# C-code-compiler-project

The purpose of this project was to create a compiler that could convert assembly code to algol C code and vice versa using C among the other languages as an intermediary. The ast.c file has the class and functions for an abstract syntax tree. The symtable.c file creates a symbol table which would be used to translate the code for the compiler. The emit.c file handles assembly code prints the output. They all compile without error.
